Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, sex, class, and ticket fare, which will be used to build predictive models.

Objectives
1) Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to understand patterns and relationships between features and survival rates.
2) Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
3) Build machine learning models to predict passenger survival based on available features.
4) Evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

Dataset

The project utilizes the famous Titanic dataset, which includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Binary variable indicating survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's gender
Age: Passenger's age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development

Data Loading:
1) Load the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2) Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns using visualizations and statistical methods.
4) Feature Selection: Select relevant features for model training based on insights gained from EDA.
5) Model Development: Build and train machine learning models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression,Linear Regression.
